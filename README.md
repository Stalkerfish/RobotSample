# RobotSample
## 1. What is this?

This is intended to be an android application to control a robot from OrionStar. The robot is Android-based, so we can build the app with all the facilities of the Android SDK.

## 2. Environment Setup
As said before, the robot relies on Android. Basically, all we need is setup a Android Development Environment with some specific features for each robot .

### 2.1 Setting up Android Environment
- Download Android Studio from the [oficial website](https://developer.android.com/studio).

>The installation process is pretty straight-forward, everything can be done with default options.

- Clone this repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Stalkerfish/RobotSample.git
```

When you first open Android Studio, you'll face a screen with an option to open an existing project, click on that and select the folder of the cloned repository.

As soon as the project opens, Android will load (and download if not exist) all the dependecies of the project, in this case Gradle to build the app.
